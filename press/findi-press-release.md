## Hydrogen Launches FINDI To Decentralize Financial Services
Fast-growing blockchain firm founds non-partisan consortium, attracting Fortune 500 companies, leading consultants, crypto projects, and academics at launch.

**New York, NY** (August 3, 2018): [Hydrogen](https://www.hydrogenplatform.com), recently named “[FinTech Startup of the Year](https://home.kpmg.com/lu/en/home/media/press-releases/2018/06/fintech-awards-luxembourg.html),” founds the Financial Industry Decentralization Initiative (FINDI), a non-partisan consortium to facilitate a more open, transparent, and decentralized global financial system powered by public blockchains.

  

FINDI is a collaborative working group whose purpose is to help usher in the Web 3.0, bringing security, knowledge, and trust to financial services. FINDI advocates the use of public blockchains as a superior alternative to the private and permissioned implementations pursued by many financial institutions, so as to preserve the vision for openness, transparency, and user control first promised by the advent of blockchain technology.

  

“Financial institutions want to implement public blockchain technology, but have been scared by an aggressive campaign from private blockchain consortiums, causing $500 million in spending on blockchain solutions already in 2018. FINDI is vital because financial services institutions are fast approaching the point of no return. Billions around the globe risk losing access to the blockchain revolution,” says Hydrogen’s Co-Founder, and FINDI Founding Member Mike Kane.
