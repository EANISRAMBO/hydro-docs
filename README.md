## The official Github page for important Hydro documents including whitepapers
As we continue to build out our platform, the global development community will be releasing whitepapers for all major products: Raindrop, Snowflake, Ice, Tide, and Mist.

Drafts of our [Snowflake Whitepaper](./Snowflake) and [Ice Whitepaper](./Ice) are live. In the future you can look forward to the Tide and Mist whitepapers. We also may have a few more up our sleeves that are yet to be announced üòè.
